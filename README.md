- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikitos1865
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming for a career change, open to advice on what free curriculums to follow, and some original projects that will help me showcase my knowledge and be fun to work on!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, looking to transition to back-end languages soon, would be great to get some advice where to transition to. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that beginner coders can do, maybe editing code. I have experience coding in java and HTML CSS. 
- 📫 How to reach me -message me on here, I am trying to be more active in the GitHub community, so please don't hesitate to reach out for things a beginner can help with/learn about. 
 Thanks and best of luck out there!
