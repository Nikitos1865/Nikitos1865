- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikitos1865
- 👀 I’m a software dev using github to expand my skillset and work on my own projects as well as contribute to open source projects. Open to advice on what free curriculums to follow, and some original projects that will help me showcase my knowledge and be fun to work on!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, Node.js, and how to work more with backend functions like API's and data visualization on the frontend side of things.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that beginner coders can do, maybe editing code. I have experience coding in java, HTML/CSS, javascript, Ruby. 
- 📫 How to reach me -message me on here, I am trying to be more active in the GitHub community, so please don't hesitate to reach out for things a beginner can help with/learn about. 
 Thanks and best of luck out there!
