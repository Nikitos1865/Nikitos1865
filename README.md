👋 Hi, I’m @Nikitos1865
👨‍💻 I’m a software developer with hands-on experience in React, TypeScript, Node.js, and NestJS, building full-stack web applications.
🧠 I also have research experience in computer vision and machine learning, working with Python to explore visual inference, data analysis, and model training.
🌱 I’m always expanding my skills — currently exploring more advanced backend architectures and ways to integrate data visualization into modern frontend frameworks.
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on impactful, well-structured projects (or even ambitious beginner-friendly ones) — especially where I can mentor or continue learning alongside others.
📫 Reach out to me here on GitHub! I'm actively looking to contribute, learn, and connect with others in the dev and research community.
